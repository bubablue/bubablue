 👋 Hi, I’m @bubablue
 👀 I’m quite interested in most of the actual Programming Languages, lets say from low-level languages to the high-level ones.
 🌱 I’m currently working on some web-based projects and of course, I would be happy to collaborate on any open project.
 💻 All my career has always been driven by my profuse interest for design and modeling.
 ⚙️ Few years ago I started building promo websites for small businesses, and since then i've been studying advanced programming algorithms. 
 📃 I’ve worked for an e-commerce platform here in Spain, where I was able to introduce myself to the professional programming world.
 🔧 I was in charge of implementing and launching the mobile and laptop websites for a small European food supply provider.
 ✒️ Right now, I’m excited to join the GitHub community, and work towards becoming a Web Programming senior. In the following years, 
 🚀 I also plan to work on the Front-End source languages to have a better website developing code stack.
